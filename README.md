# Synaptic Surge

The project, 'Synaptic Surge', is designed with the aim of educating users about everything related to biohacking. The information will be distilled into manageable segments to counteract the 'information overload' that many visitors might experience on similar sites. This platform caters to both novices interested in exploring the world of biohacking and seasoned veterans seeking to refine their knowledge in specific areas. In addition, a newsletter sign-up will be available to keep subscribers updated on any new scientific developments relevant to the topic at hand.

<summary><h4>Competition</h4></summary>
I have found a variety of sites that include information on Biohacking: Biohackers Lab, David Asprey, Biohacking Collective, Found My Fitness, Quantified Self, and Ben Greenfield Life. Many of them seem to revolve around a personality, which gives the information on the site more credibility. This would be difficult to compete with currently, however, with a successful, monetizable site I could hire scientific professionals to give 'Synaptic Surge' more credence.

Moreover, many of these sites create podcasts, which is an unreachable content feature right now. But I believe there could be a niche in this podcast space for anecdotal podcasts where I would interview 'Synaptic Surge' users and hear about their Biohacking experiences. This has worked well with content creators such as:

- Dr Anthony Chaffe - His focus is on the Carnivore Diet and its myriad of benefits (Dr Chaffe also interviews scientific peers, but I believe his interviews with regular people are quite powerful, as are Jake's, because it makes the subject matter more relatable.)
- Jake Steiner - His focus is on eyesight, specifically managing and even reversing myopia.

There are other sites that have a much broader focus but include information on Biohacking; Healthline and Medical News Today.

Overall, while I feel these sites succeed in educating the user they often leave me with a feeling of 'information overload' and could be broken down into more manageable chunks.

Sprint 3+ Features:

- More information on biohacking - to fulfil the ongoing business goal; 'Educate users about Biohacking'
	1. Nutrition and Diet: Biohackers pay close attention to what they consume, and often experiment with different diets (such as ketogenic, paleo, or intermittent fasting) to see how they affect health and performance.
	2. Exercise and Physical Activity: Biohackers often use specific exercise regimens to improve physical and mental health. This can range from traditional workout routines to more cutting-edge approaches like high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or electrical muscle stimulation.
	3. Sleep Optimization: Many biohackers focus on improving both the quantity and quality of their sleep, often using various tracking devices to monitor their sleep patterns and make necessary adjustments.
	4. Meditation and Mindfulness: This includes practices that improve mental health and reduce stress, such as mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, and various forms of meditation.
	5. Technology: Biohackers often use wearable technology to track various health metrics (like heart rate variability or sleep patterns) and make data-informed decisions about their lifestyle changes.
	6. Genetic and Microbiome Testing: Some biohackers use genetic testing to understand their genetic predispositions and make lifestyle changes accordingly. Similarly, microbiome testing can provide information about gut health, which is increasingly recognized as a significant factor in overall health.
	7. Environmental Design: This can involve optimizing personal living and working spaces to support health and well-being, such as using standing desks, optimizing light for circadian rhythms, or using air purifiers to improve air quality.
